Testing
=======

A literal block, we could use it for syntax definitions or
so?

::

  input command
     input pathnam


Block quotes are quoted elements

  Never give up, never surrender!

  -- Someone in a funny movie

Here now comes a transition, something we normally don't use in
LaTeX as it is an evil thing:

-------

And here we continue after the transition

Option lists are very special, they are funny program like
stuff ahdnling a lot of cases:

  -a           a nice option
  -b arg       another option
  --long       long options supported
  --very-long-options-are-still-supported
               but how will it look?
               I don't know

Another funny thing are those quoted literal blocls

::

> hello world
> what is going on
> lets have a cup of thee

A completely different thing are those things called ``admonition``
which are really funny

.. note:: This is a note admonition
   It can continue for a long time

   - and even contain
   - bullet lists

Now we are back at writting normally
