			 CafeOBJ Interpreter
			    Version 1.4.9

The files in this dierectory and its subdirectories constitute the
complete source code for CafeOBJ interpreter. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENT for compiling the system from source files.

CafeOBJ interpreter uses Common Lisp as a underlying implementation
language, and can be built on one of the following platforms:

(1) Allegro CL version 8.0 or later
(2) SBCL version 1.1.7 or later
(3) CMUCL version 19 or later [*]
(4) CLISP 2.4.9 or later

[*] CMUCL does not compile the system as of this writing (2013/5/13),
    soon will be fixed.

All of these Lisp systems are freely available except ACL.
Franz provides free version of ACL please consult to
	http://www.franz.com/

----------------------------------------------------------------------

UNCOMPRESS and UNTAR the SOURCES:

Change to a directory in which you wish to put CafeOBJ sources, 
which we shall call $src-dir.

*NOTE* please do not set the $src-dir "/usr/local" to, where the 
       the default installation process will put the run-time 
       resouces, thus some confusion will occur.

Copy the file cafeobj-1.xxx.tar.gz to the $src-dir.

	$ gzip -dc cafeobj.tar.gz | tar xvf -

This will create a directory ${src-dir}/cafeobj-1.xxx with all the
resources in it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTALLATION:

Change to the directory in which the cafeobj resouces are put ($src-dir,
see UNCOMPRESS and UNTAR the SOURCES above.)

Please read the INSTALL contained in the distribution for full installation
instructions. 
Here's a brief summary:

	$ cd cafeobj-1.xxx
	$ ./configure -with-lisp={YOUR-LISP}
	$ make
	$ sudo make install

where, 
YOUR-LISP ::= acl       ; Allegro CL
           |  cmu-pc    ; CMUCL on X86
           |  cmu-sparc ; CMUCL on Sparc, obsolete not supported
           |  sbcl      ; SBCL
           |  clisp     ; CLISP
