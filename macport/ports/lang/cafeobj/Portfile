long_description    \
 CafeOBJ is a language for writing formal (i.e. mathematical) \
 specifications of models for wide varieties of software and systems, \
 and verifying properties of them. CafeOBJ implements equational logic \
 by rewriting and can be used as a powerful interactive theorem proving \
 system. Specifiers can write proof scores also in CafeOBJ and doing \
 proofs by executing the proof scores.
