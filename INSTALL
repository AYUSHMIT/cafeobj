	    CafeOBJ Interpreter Installation Instructions
              version 1.4.11 (with PigNose)
	    ---------------------------------------------

============
Prerequisite
============
   CafeOBJ interpreter is built on Common Lisp, thus you need
some Common Lisp system to install CafeOBJ. CafeOBJ can be 
built on the following platforms:

  (1) SBCL version 1.1.7 (or later)
  (2) CMU-CL version 20D (or later)
  (3) Allegro CL version 8.0 (or later)
  (4) CLISP version 2.4.9 (or later)

At least one of these needs to be installed in the users' PATH.

About `configure'
=================
 The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for
various system-dependent variables used during compilation. It uses
those values to create a `Makefile' of the package. Finally, it
creates a shell script `config.status' that you can run in the future
to recreate the current configuration, a file `config.cache' that
saves the result of its tests to speed up re-configuring, and file
`config.log' contains compiler output(useful mainly for debugging
configure').

 If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try
to figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail
diff or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can
be considered for the next release. If at some point `config.cache'
contains result you don't want to keep, you may remove or edit it.

 The file `configure.in' is used to create `configure' by a program
called `autoconf'. You only need `configure.in' if you want to change
it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version of `autoconf'.

============
INSTALLATION
============

First of all, change to the directory in which the cafeobj resources
are put.  We shall call the directory as $src-dir.

1) Run "configure":

	$ cd $src-dir
	$ ./configure --with-lisp="platform"

"platform" specifies the Common Lisp plat form you use, and this
should be one of the followings:
	cmu-pc              -- CMUCL running on x86
	cmu-sparc           -- CMUCL running on sparc, now obsolete 
	sbcl                -- SBCL
	acl                 -- Allegro CL
        clisp               -- CLISP

-with-lisp="platform" can be omitted, in this case it defaulted
to `acl'.

`cmu-pc' is for CMU-CL running on PCs, i.e., Intel x386 or Pentium 
processor family. `cmu-sparc' is for CMU-CL running on Sun sparc
architecture. `acl' is for Allegro Common Lisp, and clisp is
for CLISP. With being supplied a "platform", system 
tries to find the path to the corresponding command. For this,
the following command names are assumed for each platform:
	(1) CMU-CL : a command `lisp'
	(2) SBCL : a command `sbcl'
	(3) ACL : a command `acl'
        (4) CLISP : a command `clisp'

You must have one of these command in your PATH environment.

You can specify an alternate destination to override the default with
the --prefix option:

     	$ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/cafe

   The default value is 
		--prefix=/usr/local/cafeobj-1.4

   We shall refer this value as $prefix.

 NOTE: The configure program will cache the result of the previous
       configure execution. If you need to re-run configure from
       scratch, you may need to run "make distclean" first to remove
       the cached configuration information.

2) Try to build it:

	$ make

 This will make the needed CafeOBJ binaries within the
 sub directories. If something fails for your system, and you want to
 submit a bug report, you may wish to include your "config.status"
 file, your host type, operating system and information about GCL
 (version number), make output, and anything else you think will be
 helpful. 

3) Install the binaries, examples, preludes...

	$ (sudo) make install

   This will install CafeOBJ interpreter (cafeobj).
   If you not have the permission to write target path,
   you may supply 'sudo' before 'make' for obtaining the authority.

   Some sub-directory under $prefix will be made iff do not exist, and
   necessary files are put under them:

       $prefix/bin     -- executables. cafeobj and cafeobj.XX
		          cafeobj is a shell script which invokes
                          cafeobj.exe.
       $prefix/exs     -- example module files.
       $prefix/lib     -- standard libraries, if you made cafeobj with
                          PigNose, fopl.mod will be put here.
       $prefix/prelude -- cafeobj standard prelude files.
       /usr/local/bin/cafeobj -- symbolic link to $prefix/bin/cafeobj
                                 If you need to change the place, please
                                 edit Makefile.
       $prefix/prelude/std.bin -- system initialization internal code.

4) Clean up:

	$ make clean
   
   This removes the program binaries and object files from the object code
   from $src-dir.
